# Two Traffic Lights Tick

This directory contains the following file:
  * `twotrafficlights.sv` - template for the exercise
  * `twofrafficlights_tester.sv` - the tester used by Moodle to test your design.

Note that the tester relies on having a correct design to test against called `twotrafficlights_golden.sv`, which is not provided since you we don't want to provide the answer!  However, you could modify the tester to just display the output from your design so that you can inspect it for correctness.
